## Status of this module

I wrote this module because I had need of it for a one-time migration, and
I've chosen to share it, since it might be useful to others.

I have no immediate use for it in the future, so I don't have much
incentive to put more work into it, but if others want to pitch in, 
I'll be happy to accept pull requests.

### Not implemented

The following things are currently not imported from Ghost, but should be
reasonably trivial to add migrations for:

* Images
* Meta tags/descriptions
* Multilingual content (all imported content will be imported as the site 
  default language)
* Post ownership
* Tag hierarchy
* User accounts, roles, and permissions
* Settings
